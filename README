Description

The application aims at raising productivity at work for those working with Microsoft Access by limiting what the user can do with the application and operating system. 


Features

- hide Taskbar
- disable Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete)
- hook keyboard (disable Ctrl, Alt and Windows Key, and pressing Alt+F12 causes a password form for disabling the application to come up)
- make MsAccess 'always on top'
- disable MsAccess window manipulation (e.g. Maximizing, Closing, etc.)
- disable spawning new processes from MsAccess (e.g. by using the Open File dialog)
- hide Ribbon Toolbar and Navigation Pane in MsAccess
- can either use already opened MsAccess, or create a new one and open a database file
- is highly configurable via an XML file


To do list

- rethink the name
- add full coverage of unit tests
- add continuous integration
- document native methods (P/Invoke)
- fix the Restore button which doesn't re-enable
- write documentation
- make running features asynchronously (hooking keyboard doesn't work if run this way)
- add dependency injection container
